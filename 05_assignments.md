Need Help Getting Started:
 Ask yourself the following questions.
Do we need to ask the user to enter information? If so, what function would we use?
Do we need a variable?  How many and what data types do they need to be?
Do we need to perform any calculations?  If so, what are they?  Calculate with pen and paper first if need be.
Do we need to return information to the user?  If so, what function would we use?
Do we need to concatenate (combine) strings and integers?
