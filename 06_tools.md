I have to admit, that I have been keeping things very simple thus far. I have only used ProjectStem, CodeSkulptor and Google Classroom in my CS classes.

The tech tool I currently use most is the IDE CodeSkulptor.    
I use it in my Intro to CS w/ Python classes in conjunction with the on-line curriculum ProjectSTEM for independent code practice.
I needed to find an alternative IDE from the one in ProjectStem because the "Answer Key" used to grade student work is to rigid.
It is easy to use, no logins are required, students can collaborate, the error messages are very descriptive, 
and it has a DOCS tab where students can quickly and easily look up functions and code samples.  
It needs to be used in conjunction with another program because there is no way post assignments or grade assignments.

The second tech tool I use is ProjectSTEM.  I use ProjectStem to provide a curriculum map/pacing guide and supplenental instruction.  
I assign most of the assignments in Project Stem because I like the gradebook feature, but do 
a significant amount of independent coding in CodeSkulptor.  The biggest criticism about ProjectStem is that it's grading mechanism is very frustrating for students. 
My work around for that is Codeskulptor.  Another complaint that I have heard is the the curriculum is not "jazzy" or engaging enough.  
I persnoally like the level of detail provided in the video instruction.
What I also like about ProjectStem is that interesting /engaging topics are interspersed throughout the year; such as Earsketch, virtual guest speakers, 
virtual field trips and career research projects. Their teacher support is also excellent.
