At Curtis High School, we offer a rigorous sequence of CS courses that are designed to meet the NYS requirements for CTE approval.  As a result, most of the students programmed for our courses are in our small learning community (Software Engineering Institute - SEI).  I would like to design a full year, entry level course for students outside our CTE sequence that touches on many CS concepts, skills and applications without going into much detail.  I like to consider it an Intro to CS for non-SEI students. 

I would like to start off with Scratch.  It is visually engaging and its various tutorials and block programming make it an ideal entry point.  I would then like to switch off to HTML and CSS.  This is also an easy entry point into CS since there is no coding involved.  After that I would move on to object based programming; Python and JavaScript.  Students will learn beginner coding concepts such as algorithms, abstractions, Booleans, looping and conditionals.  I would like to allocate some time for students to create research projects on careers in CS as new technological innovations. I would also like to include many unplugged and hands-on activities.  Throughout the year, I would like to keep an emphasis on critical thinking, problem solving and creativity and FUN.
